Description: |
    GNU Libtool is a set of shell scripts which automatically configure UNIX and
    UNIX-like systems to generically build shared libraries. Libtool provides a
    consistent, portable interface which simplifies the process of using shared
    libraries.
    
    If you are developing programs which will use shared libraries, but do not use
    the rest of the GNU Autotools (such as GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake), you
    should install the libtool package.
    
    The libtool package also includes all files needed to integrate the GNU 
    Portable Library Tool (libtool) and the GNU Libtool Dynamic Module Loader
    (ltdl) into a package built using the GNU Autotools (including GNU Autoconf
    and GNU Automake).

    - autoconf >= 2.58

      Description: |
          The libtool-ltdl package contains the GNU Libtool Dynamic Module Loader, a
          library that provides a consistent, portable interface which simplifies the
          process of using dynamic modules.
          
          These runtime libraries are needed by programs that link directly to the
          system-installed ltdl libraries; they are not needed by software built using 
          the rest of the GNU Autotools (including GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake).
